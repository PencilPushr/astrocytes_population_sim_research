# astrocytes_population_sim

## General Info

This is the code of the paper "Engineering Molecular Communications of Astrocytes for Logic Gate Operations". You may find the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06646.

## How to use it

You may run the code with initial configuration
- python astrocytes_population_sim.py
  
Alternatevely, the code supports the pypy interpreter, therefore use
- pypy astrocytes_population_sim.py

## Notes

- The code available will not automatically reproduce the content of the paper. It will give the code of the simulator used, however, you may need to understand each graph in order to adjust the simulator that can give the same results of the paper. 
- This code will only work for the theoretical results only!!
